The code is undergoing important reestructuring that will be sumarized here:

1. The code is now structurate in directories whose dependency level is 
   defined by a lowercase letter on the beggining of each folder:

   The structure of the sources looks now like this:

        a.GLOBAL
	b.FUNCTIONS
	c.SYSTEM
	d.FUNCTIONS_EXTRA
	e.FDATA
	f.MPI
	g.XC_FUNCTIONALS
	h.SOLVESH
	i.GRID
	j.ASSEMBLERS
	k.DASSEMBLERS
	l.SCF
	m.MD
	n.NAC
	o.OUTPUT
	p.HARRIS
	q.DOGS
	t.TRANSITIONS
	u.UTIL
	v.BEGIN
	x.EXECUTABLES

   Each level could only relies on modules from lower levels so compilation
   could follow a very clean incremental direction.


2. For a transition period there are two ways of compiling the executables:
   The traditional way by executing:

   make fireball.x

   Or the new way, by compiling libraries on each
